# airbnb

An Airbnb data analysis project working to visualize answers for the following questions:

- Is there any correlation between the price of a listing and the overall satisfaction?
- Do hosts typically have multiple listings at the same time?
- How do the prices of a rental change over time?
- How different are the prices in different neighborhoods?
